# Logo Setup Instructions

## Required Action

Please save the astronaut logo image (the circular astronaut image you provided) to the following location:

**File path:** `public/astronaut-logo.png`

This will:
1. Display the astronaut logo in the navigation bar at the top of the page
2. Replace the Lovable logo throughout the application

## What's Been Done

✅ Removed all Lovable watermark references from `index.html`
✅ Created a new `Navigation` component with the astronaut logo
✅ Added the Navigation component to the main page

## Next Steps

1. Save your astronaut logo image as `astronaut-logo.png` in the `public` folder
2. Optionally, you can also replace `public/favicon.ico` with a favicon version of the astronaut logo

The logo will automatically appear once the image file is in place!
